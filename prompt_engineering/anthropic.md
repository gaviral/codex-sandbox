# Anthropic Prompt Engineering Guidance

Source: https://docs.anthropic.com/claude/docs/prompt-engineering

Anthropic organizes its prompt engineering techniques from general to advanced. Key recommendations include:

- **Prompt generator** – Use tooling to draft initial prompts.
- **Be clear and direct** – State instructions plainly to minimize ambiguity.
- **Use examples (multishot prompting)** – Show Claude how to respond by providing sample interactions.
- **Let Claude think (chain of thought)** – Encourage step-by-step reasoning before giving the final answer.
- **Use XML tags** – Mark up sections of the prompt to control scope and improve parsing.
- **Give Claude a role (system prompts)** – Assign roles or personas to guide style and behavior.
- **Prefill Claude’s response** – Start the reply to steer format or style.
- **Chain complex prompts** – Break long requests into linked prompts for more reliable results.
- **Long context tips** – Manage very long conversations or documents with summarization or filtering.
