# OpenAI Prompt Engineering Guidance

Source: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering

OpenAI highlights six key strategies for getting better results from GPT models:

- **Write clear instructions** – Specify desired format, length, persona, and steps so the model doesn't have to guess.
- **Provide reference text** – Supply relevant documents to reduce fabrication and improve accuracy.
- **Split complex tasks into simpler subtasks** – Break problems down and sequence prompts to handle each part.
- **Give the model time to think** – Encourage reasoning or ask the model to work out solutions before answering.
- **Use external tools** – Combine the model with search, code execution, or other tools to extend capabilities.
- **Test changes systematically** – Evaluate prompts against gold‑standard answers and iterate based on results.
