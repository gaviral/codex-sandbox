# Google Prompt Engineering Guidance

Source: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting

Google's developer documentation for Gemini models emphasizes the following best practices:

- **Give explicit and concise instructions** so the model knows exactly what you want.
- **Provide context or background information** to ground the response.
- **Specify the desired output format and length** to control structure and verbosity.
- **Include examples or templates** to demonstrate ideal responses.
- **Break complex tasks into steps** and use structured prompts for reliability.
- **Iterate and refine prompts** based on model outputs to improve quality over time.
- **Respect safety guidelines** by avoiding sensitive data and reviewing responses.
